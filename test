##Question
#Suppose the cover price of a book is $24.95, but bookstores get a 40% discount. Shipping costs
#$3 for the first copy and 75 cents for each additional copy. What is the total wholesale cost for
#60 copies?

    if numberofcopies > 1:
        totalprice = numberofcopies*price*discountrate + (numberofcopies - 1)* (shipcost - shipdiscount) + shipcost
    elif numberofcopies > 0:
        totalprice = price*discountrate+shipcost
    print('Total price is:%.2f' % totalprice)
    print('Total price is:', int(totalprice))
    print('')
